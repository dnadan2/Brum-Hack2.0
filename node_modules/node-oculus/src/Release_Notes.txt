Oculus SDK 0.4.2 Release Notes - Runtime Rev 1----------------------------------------------After installing the SDK, update the Oculus DK2 firmwareto the most recent version, 2.12. The Firmware update dialog can be found under"Tools / Advanced / Update Firmware..." menu of the Oculus ConfigurationUtility. If you experience any issues, please refer to the Troubleshootingand Known Issues sections below.New SDK Features----------------* Added OVRServiceLauncher Windows service, resolving the issue with the service not   launching automatically on some systems.  * Added a new chroma setting for minimum eye relief, improving chromatic aberration   correction when configured through the Oculus Configuration Utility.  * Added “Riftsaver” mode, which turns off Rift display in direct mode if the headset is not in use.* Adding App rendered support for DK2 latency testing in CAPI and OculusRoomTiny.Bug Fixes since 0.4.1---------------------* Removed ATL references from the LibOVR Win32 Display code.* Fixed full core utilization of Oculus Configuration Utility when in Desktop mode.* Fixed the lag in Oculus Configuration Utility when the service is stopped.* Miscellaneous improvements to the Oculus Runtime Service (now called OVRServer)Unity* Fixed crashes and corruption when using 64-bit client with 32-bit service.* Fixed NullReferenceExceptions due to script initialization order.* Fixed race conditions in TimeWarp responsible for camera stutter.Troubleshooting---------------The most likely issues you may experience with DK2 is scene Judder and Vsync tearing.Here we describe these issues and provide advice on addressing them.* Scene Judder - The whole view jitters as you look around, producing a strobing  back-and-forth effect. This effect is the result of skipping frames (or Vsync)  on a low-persistence display, it will usually be noticeable on DK2 when frame rate  falls below 75 FPS. This is often the result of insufficient GPU performance or  attempting to render too complex of a scene. Optimizing the engine or scene content  should help.    We expect the situation to improve in this area as we introduce asynchronous  timewarp and other optimizations over the next few months.   If you experience this on DK2 with multiple monitors attached, please try   disabling one monitor to see if the problem goes away.* VSync tear - A vertical tear line appears in one of the eyes of the display.  This is the result of vsync timing being done incorrectly in either our display  driver or Windows composition. Disabling one of the monitors, disabling windows  composition, or switching the Oculus driver mode may help. We are working on  resolving vsync issue across in future releases.0.4.2 Rev 1 Known Issues - LibOVR and Display Driver----------------------------------------------------* Monitors in multiple display configurations will blink when activating the Rift.* Intel hardware as a single GPU configuration is generally too slow to run  VR scenes with DK2. The most obvious effect will be judder.* Using duplicated displays in Windows will lead to display driver restart  when activating the Rift. The work around is use to use Extend Desktop mode.* Nvidia Optimus GPU configurations are not universally supported.  Some Windows 7 and 8 configurations were tested successfully.  Windows 8.1 is more likely to have issues.* Use of both DK1 and DK2 at the same time is not supported.* DK2 display may fail to work if plugged in after DK1 was unplugged and used in  Direct Mode. When this happens, status LED will blink with alternating  yellow-blue pattern. The work around is to switch to Extended Desktop mode and back.* Open GL rendering can have vsync tear with Nvidida cards in Extended Desktop mode.  Try direct Display Mode.* On some Radeon graphics cards, multisampling may cause scene judder.  The work wound is to turn-off multi-sampling for the back buffer.* Updates on another monitor may interfere with vsync timing on the Rift and this can  manifest  as visible tearing in the Rift. This can be eliminated in Windows 7 by   disabling Windows composition.  * It is necessary to restart the Config Util after updating the Headset firmware.* Camera bound menu option is shown in Config Util Demo Scene for DK1. It has no  effect when a DK1 is connected.* Sample renderer doesn't and OWD sample does not honor Multisampling  setting in OpenGL.* The runtime installer does not support downgrading to previous versions  of the installer.  If you need to go back to a previous version, first  uninstall the current version and then install the previous one.Known Issues - Unity--------------------* Unity app latency on Mac is higher than in C++ OWD resulting in slightly swimmy display.* Direct Mode Unity apps may judder on multi-monitor configurations.  Please try disconnecting one monitor as a work-around.* Unity applications built with DX11 support may crash at exit.  Use DX9 where possible.* OpenGL in Direct mode is not functional in Unity.Known Issues - UE4------------------* UE4: OpenGL is not supported on Windows in current release.* UE4: Direct Mode sometimes does not Vsync correctly.
